# grandpy_bot

## Fonctionality

* Interactions in AJAX: the user sends his question by pressing enter and the answer is displayed directly in teh screen, without reloading the page.
* You will use the Google Maps API and the Media Wiki API.
* Nothing is saved. if the user loads the page again, all history is lost.
* You can have fun inventing several different answers from GrandPy but it is not an obligation. Have fun !
